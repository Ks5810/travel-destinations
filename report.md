## Sat 6/6
Completed:
- Read [Laravel Frontend] and tried custom webpack configuration and faild
- Decided to use mix
- Implemented form in React

Notes:
- Used Object for `Usestate` declaration AGAIN AND WAISTED AN HOUR.
- `mix.react()` is not working with `mix.webpackConfig()` which is obvious
- Maybe use `mix.webpackConfig()` instead of ''`mix.react()` for production setting?
- `app.blade.php` is like the template file in Django
- Backend is responding with Internal server error

Todo:
- Post `Destination` and Get `Destinations` wihtout authentication
